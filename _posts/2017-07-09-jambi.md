I love creating and building.  Anything from software to art to fighting robots for my sons.

I'm always using resources from the internet to piece together the knowledge on how to do these projects, however I never post what I've learned.

This theme is organized around categories and posts, a minimalistic structure that I hope will lead to frequent posts.
